/*Given an array 'arr' of 'n' non-negative integers, your task is to move all the zeros to the end of the array while keeping the non-zero elements at the start of the array in their original order. Return the modified array.



Example :
Input: ‘n’ = 5, ‘arr’ = [1, 2, 0, 0, 2, 3]
Output: [1, 2, 2, 3, 0, 0]

Explanation: Moved all the 0’s to the end of an array, and the rest of the elements retain the order at the start.
Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Sample input 1:
4
0 0 0 1 
Sample output 1:
1 0 0 0 
Explanation of sample input 1:
Output: [1, 0, 0, 0]

We move all the 0’s to the end of an array, and the rest of the elements retained the order at the start.
Sample input 2:
5
4 0 3 2 5 
Sample output 2:
4 3 2 5 0 
Explanation of sample input 2:
Output: [4, 3, 2, 5, 0]

we move all the 0’s to the end of an array, and the rest of the elements retained the order at the start.
Expected time complexity:
 The expected time complexity is O(n).
Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9

Time limit: 1 sec*/
